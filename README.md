# BFSI Sentiment Analysis with NLP and Generative AI

This repository contains code for a hackathon project aimed at predicting sentiment for financial news headlines using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Generative AI models.

## Problem Statement

The task is to develop a solution to predict sentiment for financial news headlines using NLP and Generative AI techniques. The primary goal is to accurately classify the sentiment of headlines as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset

The training dataset (`train.csv`) contains news headlines along with their sentiment labels.

## Code Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation.
- `train.csv`: Training data file containing news headlines and their sentiment labels.

## Libraries Used

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
- wordcloud: For generating word clouds.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip.
3. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook to execute the code.

## Results

The code performs sentiment analysis on financial news headlines and provides insights into the sentiment distribution. Additionally, it includes a machine learning model to classify sentiment and evaluates its accuracy.
